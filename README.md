> Smart media tagging for Nextcloud

This app goes through your media collection and adds fitting tags, automatically categorizing your photos and music.

* üì∑ üë™ Recognizes faces from contact photos
* üì∑ üèî Recognizes animals, landscapes, food, vehicles, buildings and other objects
* üì∑ üóº Recognizes landmarks and monuments
* üëÇ üéµ Recognizes music genres
* ‚ö° Tagging works via Nextcloud's Collaborative Tags, allowing access by any of your apps
  * üëÇ listen to your tagged music with the audioplayer app
  * üì∑ view your tagged photos with the photos app

Note: This project is quite young and thus still a bit rough around the edges.

### Examples

### Privacy
This app does not send any sensitive data to cloud providers or similar services. All image processing is done on your nextcloud machine, using Tensorflow.js running in Node.js, which comes bundled with this app.

### Categories
This is the [list of recognized things and which categories they are currently mapped to](https://github.com/marcelklehr/recognize/blob/master/src/rules.yml). I'm happy to accept pull requests for this file to fine tune predictions.

## Behind the scenes
Recognize uses

 * a pre-trained [Efficient](https://github.com/google/automl/tree/master/efficientnetv2)[Net v2](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/efficientnet_v2/1) model for ImageNet object detection.
 * a pre-trained [model trained on the Landmarks v1 dataset](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/landmarks/1) for landmark recognition.
 * [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) to extract and compare face features.
 * a [Musicnn](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06654) neural network architecture to classify audio files into music genres. Also see [the original musicnn repository](https://github.com/jordipons/musicnn).

## Install

### Requirements

- php 7.3 and above
- App "collaborative tags" enabled
- For native speed:
  - Processor: x86 64bit (with support for AVX instructions)
  - System with glibc (usually the norm on Linux; Alpine linux and FreeBSD are *not* such systems)
- For sub-native speed (using JavaScript mode)
  - Processor: x86 64bit, arm64, armv7l (no AVX needed)
  - System with glibc or musl (incl. Alpine linux)
- ~4GB of free RAM (if you're cutting it close, make sure you have some swap available)

### One click

Go to "Apps" in your nextcloud, search for "recognize" and click install (currently only works on Nextcloud v22+. If you're below that, you'll need to install manually).

### Configuration

Any configuration is done in Settings/Recognize of your Nextcloud instance.

You can also ignore directories (and their children) by adding a `.noimage`, `.nomusic` or `.nomedia` file in them.

### Manual install

#### Dependencies

- [git](https://git-scm.org/)
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- [php](https://php.net/)
